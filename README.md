# Game-of-Life
he Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is not a traditional game with players and rules but rather a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It's fascinating to observe the patterns and structures that emerge from the simple rules of this cellular automaton.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create the Game of Life using JavaScript. We will use the HTML and CSS to create the user interface for displaying the grid, and JavaScript to implement the rules of the game and control the simulation.

<b>There are three different code versions of the same Game of Life:</b>

<b>JavaScript Version:</b> This version is implemented solely using JavaScript. It involves creating the grid, defining the Game of Life rules, updating the grid state, and handling user interactions all using plain JavaScript code.

<b>JavaScript Version with p5.js Library:</b> This version uses the p5.js library, which simplifies drawing and animation in JavaScript. The p5.js library provides functions to create a canvas, draw shapes, and handle animation easily. The Game of Life logic is implemented using JavaScript, while p5.js is used for the graphical representation of the grid.

<b>CSS Version: </b>This version uses CSS to create the grid layout and styling for the Game of Life. The JavaScript code is responsible for defining the Game of Life rules, updating the grid state, and handling user interactions, while the visual representation and layout are handled using CSS styles.

Each version offers different approaches to implementing the Game of Life, catering to various programming preferences and allowing for exploration of different techniques.
