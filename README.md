# Game-of-Life
he Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is not a traditional game with players and rules but rather a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It's fascinating to observe the patterns and structures that emerge from the simple rules of this cellular automaton.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create the Game of Life using JavaScript. We will use the HTML and CSS to create the user interface for displaying the grid, and JavaScript to implement the rules of the game and control the simulation.
